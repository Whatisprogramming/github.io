    <h2 class="h2">1․ What is programming?</h2>
<p class="p3">Programming is a sequence of instructions that people give to computers to perform certain actions. For example, one of the students of Sisian High School, Edgar, created the "Smart Clock", which rings the school bell every 45 minutes, and some music is played in the middle of the class. Or one of the Facebook apps tells you every day which of your friends' birthdays are today.</p>
  <h2 class="h3">2․ What is the meaning of programming?</h2>
  <p class="p4">In the first point, we saw that programming is a sequence of instructions that people give to a computer to perform certain actions. But why do we do that, because people can ring the school bell every 45 minutes or turn on music in between classes? This is the answer, that is, the programming is created to make people's lives easier, to solve our problems, to make our work more efficient. The most important advantages of programming are that computers never get tired, never sleep, can work 24 hours a day, have a lot of memory, are much faster than humans.</p>   
  <h2 class="h4">3․ What's the easiest, most accurate way to learn programming?</h2>
  <p class="p5">This is one of the most important questions for beginners as they lose a lot of time on orientation. Here we would like to mention that there are people who learn different programming languages ​​before becoming programmers and getting a job, because they think that the more programming languages ​​they know, the faster they will find a job. But in reality it is not so right approach, because you will be able to get to work only when you manage to solve real problems through programming. That is why we will advise beginners to start from the web, because in everyday life we ​​are very much related to websites, we use a lot for example Facebook, YouTube, etc. և, it will be easier to understand the programming on websites. We recommend learning HTML and CSS, which is very easy,, creating a small project with these technologies. You can then learn, for example, JavaScript  to make your website more interactive. And if you want to improve your project more, you can learn PHP and MySQL to install your Web Application on a Web Server it works with a database.</p>
  <p class="p6">If you do not want to start from the web, you can learn Python and basic knowledge, you can create any simple project, such as Password Generator or "Guess the number" game, which we already have on our YouTube channel. Then you can learn Python Object Oriented Programming (OOP) and Create a graphical application for your computer using the PyQT Library.</p>
  <p class="p7">In the end, we want to mention that you do not need excellent knowledge to solve real problems, but you need to start from the easiest, solving the smallest problems and move on to more complex projects.</p>

<!-- Programming, the process of creating a computer program. According to the famous phrase of Niklaus Wirth, "Software = algorithms + data structures". In other words, the immediate problems of programming are the application of algorithms, the creation of data structures.;;;;div class="container">
